"""
Diachronic comparison: historical (Wikisource) vs modern (CulturaX) corpus frequencies.

For each DEX candidate, compares how much of the historical corpus it accounts for
against how much of the modern one it does, and returns a verdict.

Two things make the comparison honest, and both were added in the 2026-08-07 rescore:

1. **Counts, not ppm.** The corpora differ by 1,187× in size (14.3M vs 17.0B tokens),
   so the old shared `0.1 ppm` floor meant "fewer than 1,697 modern hits" on one side
   and "at least 1.43 historical hits" on the other. `zapciu`, with 1,322 modern
   occurrences, was classified `extinct`. Thresholds are now occurrence counts.

2. **Paradigms, not citation forms.** The corpus processors count raw tokens, so an
   inflected lemma was only credited with the one form that happens to be its headword
   (`înmărmuri` 317, while `înmărmurit` alone is 5,846). Counts are now rolled up over
   `InflectedForm` paradigms — see `aggregate_by_family`.

The historical-vs-modern comparison itself uses `rank_shift`: the word's percentile rank
within each corpus, subtracted. A rank is scale-free, so the smaller corpus's resolution
floor no longer decides the outcome. `log_ratio` is still emitted for comparison.

Verdicts (all from paradigm-level counts):
  alive            modern_occ >= 1000 — in use today, whatever the history says
  emerging         alive, and relatively more prominent now than historically
  absent           no historical footing (< 3 occurrences or < 2 documents), not common now
  extinct          historically attested, zero modern occurrences
  historical_only  historically attested, fewer than 200 modern occurrences
  declining        historically attested, 200–999 modern, and fell >= 0.15 in rank

Only `extinct`, `historical_only`, `declining` and `absent` reach the UI; `make_shortlist.py`
drops the rest (see VERDICTS in public/api/_lib.php).

Usage:
    python validate_diachronic.py               # curated candidates only
    python validate_diachronic.py --all-dex     # every DEX word in either corpus
    python validate_diachronic.py --smoothing 0.5 --output path/out.csv
    python validate_diachronic.py --top 30      # print top-30 in summary

Requires process_wikisource.py / process_culturax.py, plus extract_inflected_forms.py
and extract_dict_sources.py for the paradigm and dictionary-year columns.

    Romanian is heavily inflected and the corpus processors count raw tokens, so a lemma

        cătrăni     59  →  1,825

    Every verb was therefore pushed toward `extinct`.

    **Ambiguous forms are split, not duplicated.** ~12% of surface forms are claimed by
    more than one lemma, and naively crediting each claimant produces nonsense: `veșcă`
    (the rim of a sieve) shares its plural `vești`/`veștile` with `veste` (news), and
    would inherit all 339,710 of its occurrences.

    Each shared form's count is divided between claimants in proportion to how often each
    lemma's *own headword* appears in the corpus. That prior is what tells the two apart:

        vești     → veste 576,766 vs veșcă 264      → veste takes ~99.9%
        politețe  → politețe 33,178 vs politeță 280 → politețe takes ~99.2%

    (Weighting by "forms only one lemma claims" was tried first and fails: a noun's own
    citation form is frequently shared too — `veste` is claimed by both `veste` and
    `vestă` — so the evidence is empty for exactly the words that need it, and the split
    lands on whichever lemma happens to own some unrelated form.)

    Returns the disambiguated per-lemma estimate. `aggregate_loose` returns the
    undivided word-family total; the ratio between them is the "you would recognise a
    relative of this word" signal that `make_shortlist.py` scores on.

    Occurrences are summed (distinct tokens, so exact). Documents take the max across the
    forms a lemma dominates — a conservative lower bound on distinct documents, since
    summing would double-count any document holding two forms of the same lemma.
